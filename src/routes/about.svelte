    <p>
      I enjoy building digital products and working in projects wich are
      challenging. I move from concepts and sketches, to wireframes and
      prototypes, to high fidelity UI/UX designs. <br /><br />I am interested in
      ways to transform areas where there are gaps, to be more inclusive,
      accessible and humane. My commitment is to contribute to raise awareness
      in the creation of designs focused on the needs of users. <br /><br /> With
      my work I hope to simplify user's everyday lives with a beautiful user experience.
      One of my pillars for creating solutions is the perspective of self-reflection
      and investigation accompanied by artistic sensitivity. I love moving from design
      to implementing interactive experiences on the web, bringing ideas to life
      with meticulous care and attention to detail. <br /><br /> A little more about
      me <br />My personal experiences have taught me a few things about myself:
      I constantly educate myself, readjust and train to be a better person. I
      work daily to form positive habits. I'm always looking for new and better
      ways to solve problems.
