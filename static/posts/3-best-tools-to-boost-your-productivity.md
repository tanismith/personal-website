  Making things happen implies being clear and defined what you want and also an
  action plan to serve as a guide.


  I have recently been testing various productivity apps and tools to stay focused. I have problems focusing on tasks because there is a sea of ​​information on the internet and my attention is scattered, which is why I am always looking for new tools, tips, and tricks.


  Here are three tools that I recently discovered and found to be quite effective. They have allowed me to achieve the following results.
---
* Better manage the hours I have by investing in activities that I enjoy and are important to me.
* Visualize clearly and in an organized way the projects, objectives, and tasks that I have proposed to do in a defined time.
* Complete small tasks (in which I can hardly fail) associated with long-term results.
* Feel more motivated to complete each project, habit, or goal by seeing progress.
* Limit the time I spend scrolling the phone consuming content and statistically know the hours and days in which I am most productive.

Note: The tools may look or work differently depending on the operating system you are working on.\

### Tool 1: Notion

A super tool with a minimalist and easy-to-use interface, the app is extremely useful, a bit scary at first. Where to begin?

#### **Structure a space for effective workflow.** 

The first step is for you to draw on a sheet and draw your ideal workspace. In my case, I divided it into:

* Priority tasks in the week.
* Projects
* Tasks for today, tomorrow, and the next day.

After having the most practical idea for you, start generating a new page with the categories. I recommend using tables since you can relate characteristics from one to another, which allows you to synchronize tasks in a certain way in relation to projects or objectives you have.

Each of these categories is linked to a table where the details of each task and project are stored. For example, in the Projects category, I can enter data such as: name, relation to the objective pursued, the status (active, paused, or finished), the associated tasks are also placed and when all are completed the progress will be marked as 100 %.

This is truly a powerful motivation. As well as marking ✔️ in the task that you just completed (To-do lists)

I can use multiple pages and organize them in a useful way. To get started it is excellent to use [templates](https://www.notion.so/Notion-Template-Gallery-181e961aeb5c4ee6915307c0dfd5156d) and play around with them.

Outside of work I also use space for my long-term goals, habits I'm practicing, book list, journal, notes, etc.

Notion also has a mobile app, so I can keep track of pending tasks, documents, and the status of a project from the phone.

The most important thing is that you organize it in a way that works for you. Everyone has their way of doing things and their priorities.

#### Prices

You can use the personal account plan, it is a free version, although the paid version offers a few more things, especially if you want to work with more people and save previous versions of your pages (file).
