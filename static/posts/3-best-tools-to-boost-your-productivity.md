  Making things happen implies being clear and defined what you want and also an
  action plan to serve as a guide.


  I have recently been testing various productivity apps and tools to stay focused. I have problems focusing on tasks because there is a sea of ​​information on the internet and my attention is scattered, which is why I am always looking for new tools, tips, and tricks.


  Here are three tools that I recently discovered and found to be quite effective. They have allowed me to achieve the following results.
---
* Better manage the hours I have by investing in activities that I enjoy and are important to me.
* Visualize clearly and in an organized way the projects, objectives, and tasks that I have proposed to do in a defined time.
* Complete small tasks (in which I can hardly fail) associated with long-term results.
* Feel more motivated to complete each project, habit, or goal by seeing progress.
* Limit the time I spend scrolling the phone consuming content and statistically know the hours and days in which I am most productive.

Note: The tools may look or work differently depending on the operating system you are working on.\

### Tool 1: Notion

A super tool with a minimalist and easy-to-use interface, the app is extremely useful, a bit scary at first. Where to begin?

#### **Structure a space for effective workflow.**

The first step is for you to draw on a sheet and draw your ideal workspace. In my case, I divided it into:

* Priority tasks in the week.
* Projects
* Tasks for today, tomorrow, and the next day.

After having the most practical idea for you, start generating a new page with the categories. I recommend using tables since you can relate characteristics from one to another, which allows you to synchronize tasks in a certain way in relation to projects or objectives you have.

Each of these categories is linked to a table where the details of each task and project are stored. For example, in the Projects category, I can enter data such as: name, relation to the objective pursued, the status (active, paused, or finished), the associated tasks are also placed and when all are completed the progress will be marked as 100 %.

This is truly a powerful motivation. As well as marking ✔️ in the task that you just completed (To-do lists)

I can use multiple pages and organize them in a useful way. To get started it is excellent to use [templates](https://www.notion.so/Notion-Template-Gallery-181e961aeb5c4ee6915307c0dfd5156d) and play around with them.

Outside of work I also use space for my long-term goals, habits I'm practicing, book list, journal, notes, etc.

Notion also has a mobile app, so I can keep track of pending tasks, documents, and the status of a project from the phone.

The most important thing is that you organize it in a way that works for you. Everyone has their way of doing things and their priorities.

#### Prices

You can use the personal account plan, it is a free version, although the paid version offers a few more things, especially if you want to work with more people and save previous versions of your pages (file).

### Tool 2. Forest App

Picking up the cell phone every 5 min just to swipe without meaningful purpose is a habit that takes up valuable time. Forest App makes it easy to put your phone down to focus on important tasks.

With this app a forest grows while I focus on a task, first I choose the type of tree I want to plant and then I decide the time (every 30, 60, 90, or 120 min) to work. If for any reason I leave the app the trees die. My sense of responsibility and my sincere appreciation for plants do not allow me to let trees die, so day after day I do my best.

A plus that this app has is that with the points generated, a real tree is planted through the [Trees for Future Foundation](https://trees.org/waystohelp/). It is a great opportunity to contribute. I've got 5 real trees planted.

My forest looks like this after planting a whole week. The beauty of this is that developing the habit of consistency and focus is priceless.

#### Know when you are most productive

Forest presents complete statistics, it is here where I was able to know in what hours and days I'm most productive. I also drastically reduced the time spent in front of the phone screen. The 6 hours decreased to 1 hr 30 min. \
\
By making me more aware of my available time and spending it on important activities, I also avoid overloading my mind with unnecessary information.

If you go for the premium version, you can plant trees with friends, it also allows you to have a list of applications that you can use in the background, the objective is that you do not use the ones that instead of adding, subtract energy.

In the beginning, it was difficult and in order not to be tempted to take the phone, so I combined this app with the third in the top 3.

### Tool 3. AppBlock

One of the simplest apps I found. AppBlock allows you to schedule specific times to block applications and their websites. On my list: All social including WhatsApp and Google Photos.

The app is protected from being deactivated while it is running. I feel calmer by not receiving notifications on the screen, over time I have seen that the anxiety about taking the phone has decreased and my productivity has increased.

These three tools have helped me organize, prioritize, and have more goals accomplished.

Do you use any of these applications? Let me know. I am always interested in how others maximize their productivity.
