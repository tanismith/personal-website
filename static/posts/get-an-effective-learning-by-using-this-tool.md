## The structure

To start divide the page into 4 parts: a header, a footer (both are of the page width), and two columns between the header and footer, one narrower than the other.

**Header:** Here you can write the date and the main topic. You can also write an identifier, ex: Class 4, I added this one because it helps me to have a reference of the content or information sources.

**Recall/Clues:** It's recommended to give space between each written keyword, vocabulary, or idea. Formulate questions as soon as you can read the right-hand column will help you to clarify the meaning, find relations, and strengthen memory. Writing questions will help you to study for future exams.

**Notes:** Use paraphrase to write the ideas, it means to use your own words but avoid too long sentences and apply symbols like arrows, warnings, etc. Using colors helps a lot to give hierarchy to the ideas. When rereading your notes you can reflect on the material by asking yourself questions like: "How can it be applied?", " What's beyond these ideas?", "How can it be similar or connected to something that I already knew?", etc. To remember basic concepts, recite by answering the main questions while hiding the right-hand column.

**Summary:** Write what you just learned with your own words. This is the most important part because you internalize knowledge.

As you can see, Cornell Notes helps us to remember easily using a structured organization of ideas. These can be applied by anybody who wants to be effective in learning something new because it encourages people to reflect on their ideas by summarizing them in their own words.

### Some tips:

* Try to use just one page for any topic.
* Review your notes at least 10 minutes 7 days after and one month after they were taken. If you do that you're boosting your memory to retain a great deal of information for current and future use.

Finally, you can practice explaining to someone else if you can do that in the simplest way the knowledge is yours. Yeah! You got the power! Go and try for yourself!
