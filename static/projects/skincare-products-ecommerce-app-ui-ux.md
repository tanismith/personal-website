## Challenge 

The challenge was to create a design for an eCommerce app that makes the shopping experience simple and enjoyable.  The products shown are from an Ecuadorian brand specialized in cruelty-free, vegan, paraben-free lines of skincare products. 

* Define the user
* Wireframes
* UX /UI Design
* Prototype

## Defining the user

In order to design the best experience is demanded to focus on the user and the usual expectations of shopping online.

### Short user description

To make this possible the brand provided collected information from its users. Besides I applied an observational research method to determine behaviors, quotes, responses of the customers by seeing what actually happens in real-time.

I could determine which type of user will be the app designed for.\
This app focuses on female users who are looking for vegan products to maintain both facial and body skincare.

Their commitment and love for ecology motivate them to use products not tested on animals and free of aggressive chemicals.

They prefer to buy online because of the ease of finding the products they are looking for and the convenience of receiving their products at home.

## Defining App features

### User's conventions on eCommerce

* Simple and fast experience when shopping online
* Easy to browse and select products
* Look for rating and reviews
* Enough information for each product
* Free shipping
* Simple payment method

The app features have been categorized into two groups. For the first app's version, it's important to know what are the main "must be" features.

### Basic

* User-friendly product filtering and sorting
* Product pages with detailed descriptions
* Shopping bag
* Shipping options
* Order summary
* Secure and easy in-app methods payment
* Product scores and reviews

### Additional

* Product gallery
* Related products
* Wishlist
* Flash sales and discounts
* Membership options
* Item availability reminder
* Presenting products with tiny videos

## Design System

The brand colors are smooth and elegant. The typography selected is clear and simple. These are the style guides to standard future designs.

## Wireframes

Before making the mockups, wireframes have been designed to define the main screens to test and adjust.

## UI/UX Design

This is the result after defining the user, wireframing, testing, and designing the UI. It has the main features and steps in the flow of an online experience.

The prototype was presented to the brand to be implemented. Understanding the benefits that a good UX/UI brings to enhance the brand, create trust, and increase sales they're considering the proposal to invest next year in this digital product.\
