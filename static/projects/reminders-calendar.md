The app allows the users to add a new reminder.  They can choose day and time, also select color when creating a reminder. Selecting a city shows the weather forecast. The created reminders display on the calendar view in the correct time order and they can be edited. \
\
To design the layout I use GESTALT principles as similarity, proximity, closure, connection.\
To create the UI I consider:\
Group Similar functions or menu Items by proximity.\
Obscure backgrounds behind modal boxes.\
Constrain headlines to respective sections.\
Remove unnecessary borders from design elements\
Hide infrequent but necessary features, and information\
Use descriptive button labels\
Use graphics to communicate better the weather\
\
All these reduce the effort and mantain the flow of the user while using the web app.\
