## **Challenge**

Creating UX/UI for both users and the company. Mashpi Chocolate Artesanal is a recognized brand of chocolate. Winner of awards locally and internationally. Located in the Andean Chocó of Ecuador.
\
The growth of the business demanded the need to update its E-commerce website to position itself and sell its products.

### Stage 1: Know the brand

To get a better idea I conducted an interview with Manuela, the brand's commercial representative. By understanding the brand's strengths, who is its audience, competitors. \
\
Every website should have a goal, with every design decision aligned to it, so we established the general objectives of the new Website:

* Positive and notable exposure of the brand on the internet through the redesign of informative pages to disseminate its history, chocolate production, awards, and projects carried out for the protection of analog forests.
* Online sale of products for Ecuador and the United States through the total redesign of its E-commerce website: product pages, shopping cart, checkout, shipping, and payment method.
* Channel for contact with prospects for distributors and visitors at the farm where they make chocolate.

 I did an audit of the previous Website to prioritize design decisions.

As a result, I found pages that aren’t directly tied to the site’s purpose, there wasn't a site map to hierarchical information, pages with duplicate content, pictures and videos out of place that doesn't show the real value of the brand.\
\
I made detailed documentation of what is necessary to achieve the proposed objectives. I compiled visual resources of the brand such as photography of the business and products.

Based on the information brief, the architecture of the website was defined.

### Stage 3: Styles selection

There wasn´t a style guide or manual. The brand needed the styles to remain in harmony with its logo and product packaging. It was agreed to use previously used colors and fonts.
