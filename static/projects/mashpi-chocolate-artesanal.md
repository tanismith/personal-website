## **Challenge**

Mashpi Chocolate Artesanal is a recognized brand of chocolate. Winner of awards locally and internationally. Located in the Andean Chocó of Ecuador.
\
The growth of the business demanded the need to update its E-commerce website to position itself and sell its products.

### Stage 1 Preparation: Research and documentation

To get a better idea I conducted an interview with Manuela, the brand's commercial representative, together we established the objectives of the new Website:

* Online sale of products for Ecuador and the United States through the total redesign of its E-commerce website: product pages, shopping cart, checkout, shipping, and payment method.
* Positive and notable exposure of the brand on the internet through the redesign of informative pages to disseminate its history, chocolate production, awards, and projects carried out for the protection of analog forests.
* Channel for contact with prospects for distributors and visitors at the farm where they make chocolate.

I did an audit of the previous Website.

As a result, the website needs a complete redesign to start, I made detailed documentation of what is necessary to achieve the proposed objectives. I compiled visual resources of the brand such as photography of the business and products.

Based on the information brief, the architecture of the website was defined.

### Stage 2: Wireframes

During the wireframing, I drew the necessary screens to ensure a good UX before bringing the design to the user interface.

### Stage 3: Styles selection

There wasn´t a style guide or manual. The brand needed the styles to remain in harmony with its logo and product packaging. It was agreed to use previously used colors and fonts.

### Stage 5: Evaluation and adjustments

The client asked to include new photos and a new "ingredients" section within the "Our chocolate" page. More color was added to backgrounds with brand illustrations.
