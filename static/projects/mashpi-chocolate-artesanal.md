## **Challenge**

Creating UX/UI for both users and the company. Mashpi Chocolate Artesanal is a recognized brand of chocolate. Winner of awards locally and internationally. Located in the Andean Chocó of Ecuador.
\
The growth of the business demanded the need to update its E-commerce website to position itself and sell its products.

## Stage 1: Know the brand

To get a better idea I conducted an interview with Manuela, the brand's commercial representative. By understanding the brand's strengths, who is its audience, competitors. \
\
Every website should have a goal, with every design decision aligned to it, so we established the general objectives of the new Website:

* Positive and notable exposure of the brand on the internet through the redesign of informative pages to disseminate its history, chocolate production, awards, and projects carried out for the protection of analog forests.
* Online sale of products for Ecuador and the United States through the total redesign of its E-commerce website: product pages, shopping cart, checkout, shipping, and payment method.
* Channel for contact with prospects for distributors and visitors at the farm where they make chocolate.

## Stage 2: Audit and IA

 I did an audit of the previous Website to prioritize design decisions.

As a result, I found pages that aren’t directly tied to the site’s purpose, there wasn't a site map to hierarchical information, pages with duplicate content, pictures and videos out of place that doesn't show the real value of the brand.\
\
I made detailed documentation of what is necessary to achieve the proposed objectives. I compiled visual resources of the brand such as photography of the business and products.

Based on the information brief, the architecture of the website was defined.

## Stage 3: Wireframes

During the wireframing, I drew the necessary screens to ensure a good UX before bringing the design to the user interface. 

Through feedbacks, I got a reality check on the redesign. I was asked to include a new "ingredients" section within the "Our chocolate" page. And I made adjustments by iterating the process.

## Stage 4: High fidelity UI

There wasn't a brand's style guide. The brand needed the styles to remain in harmony with its logo and product packaging. It was agreed to use previously used colors and fonts.

The content of the pages should guide users and help them interact with the product. So after receiving all the information about the brand (huge texts, pictures, videos, etc). I organized it and take the useful content to make sure should guide users and help them interact with the product. \
\
The copies were written concisely to get to the point. And **I made sure that shows the same style, tone, voice, and terminology that fits in with the brand**, this builds trust with the user.\
\
Home page: easy to access and navigate

Product detail page and shopping cart

Content pages: simple, clear and concise

## Stage 5: Implementation

Implementing the UX design along with the re-design UI with complete functionality and user experience was an iterative process.

I validated the product in terms of user flow and experience and identify areas where improvements were needed.

The website was built in WordPress and Woocommerce, a Spanish version for Ecuador, and an English version for the United States. The design is flexible and easy to change. The brand has control over the products they sell, they can add, edit, or delete.

## Stage 6: Results

Create a UX/UI new design website for Mashpi Chocolate, enhanced brand image, and have given a more clear value proposition that brought a higher affinity of users to trust and buy the products.\
